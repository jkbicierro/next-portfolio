Baking accessibility into every design and engineering decision from day one. Not only the right thing to do—it's a business multiplier: larger audience, better SEO, reduced legal risk, and happier teams.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- 1 in 4 adults have a disability affecting web use (CDC).
- 70% of accessibility issues are fixable by developers at minimal cost.
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance correlates with higher conversion and retention.
- Legal pressure increasing: 3,000+ accessibility lawsuits filed in 2023 alone.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Semantic HTML

```html
<!-- ❌ Bad: div soup -->
<div onclick="navigate('/about')">About</div>

<!-- ✅ Good: semantic, keyboard-navigable, screen-reader friendly -->
<a href="/about">About</a>

<!-- ✅ Good: button with ARIA role if needed -->
<button type="button" aria-label="Close menu">
  <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
</button>
```

### 2. Color & Contrast

- Text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast (normal text), 3:1 (large text).
- Interactive: 3:1 contrast for UI components and graphical elements.
- Never rely on color alone to convey information.

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements reachable via Tab and Enter.
- Focus management in modals: trap focus inside, return on close.
- Skip links for keyboard users to bypass repetitive content.

### 4. Screen Reader Testing

- Test with NVDA (Windows), JAWS, or VoiceOver (Mac).
- Describe images with meaningful `alt` text; skip decorative images.
- Announce dynamic content changes with ARIA live regions.

## Checklist

- [x] Audit codebase with axe or Lighthouse.
- [x] Add skip links to every page layout.

- [x] Ensure focus ring is visible (4px min, good contrast).
- [x] Add ARIA labels to icon-only buttons.
- [ ] Expand screen reader testing to all major products.
- [ ] Train team on accessible component patterns.

## Tools & Resources
