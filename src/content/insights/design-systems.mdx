A design system built on tokens rather than components as the source of truth. This approach decouples visual language from implementation, enabling rapid iteration and multi-platform delivery.

## The Challenge

- 40+ product surfaces with inconsistent spacing, color, and typography.
- Design and eng working in silos; changes require manual syncing.
- No single source of truth for theme adjustments or dark mode overrides.

## Token-Driven Architecture

```json
{
  "color": {
    "brand": {
      "primary": { "light": "#0052CC", "dark": "#0066FF" },
      "secondary": { "light": "#5E4FA2", "dark": "#7C5CFF" }
    },
    "semantic": {
      "success": { "light": "#216E4E", "dark": "#4BCE11" },
      "error": { "light": "#AE2A19", "dark": "#F87462" }
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "xs": "0.25rem",
    "sm": "0.5rem",
    "md": "1rem",
    "lg": "1.5rem",
    "xl": "2rem"
  }
}
```

## Adoption Path

- [x] Export design tokens from Figma to JSON + CSS custom properties.
- [x] Build component library consuming tokens, not hard-coded colors.
- [x] Sync token updates across web, mobile, and docs automatically.
- [ ] Ship design editor UI to empower non-engineers on brand team.
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework for token variants.

## Wins

- Reduced design-to-code turnaround from weeks to hours.
- Dark mode and accessibility themes ship together, not bolted on.
- Design system scales with product org; minimal maintenance overhead.

## Next Steps

- Publish design tokens as npm package for external teams.
- Extend tokens to motion and layout rhythm systems.
