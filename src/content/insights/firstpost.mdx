Redesigning a high-usage SaaS analytics dashboard to improve clarity and speed. The focus: a faster path to insights, cleaner information architecture, and measurable performance gains without sacrificing depth.

## Goals

- Reduce time-to-insight for power users navigating multi-tenant data.
- Simplify navigation and surface the right defaults for common tasks.
- Improve perceived performance and real metrics on critical views.

## UX Improvements

- Information architecture: consolidated fragmented views into Overview, Explore, Alerts.
- Visual hierarchy: consistent heading scale, emphasis on trend vs. totals, sparing use of color.
- Density tuning: adjustable row density; defaults optimized for 13–14" laptops.
- Empty states and guardrails: clear states with guidance and sample queries.
- Keyboard reachability: quick actions and global search via `cmd/ctrl + k`.

## Performance Wins

| Metric                 | Before |  After | Delta |
| ---------------------- | -----: | -----: | ----: |
| LCP (p75)              |   3.4s |   1.9s |  -44% |
| TTI (dashboard)        |   2.6s |   1.6s |  -38% |
| JS shipped (initial)   | 310 KB | 168 KB |  -46% |
| API requests (on load) |      9 |      5 |  -44% |

How we got there:

- Charting isolated behind dynamic boundaries; only critical KPIs hydrate.
- Server Components for data shaping; charts stream inside Suspense.
- Route-level caching + revalidation for common queries.
- Image/asset budgets and `next/font` for predictable layout.

### Example: Lazy‑loading heavy charts

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

// Avoids loading the charting library on initial paint
const RevenueChart = dynamic(() => import("@/components/charts/revenue"), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <div className="h-48 rounded-md bg-muted animate-pulse" />,
});

export function RevenueSection() {
  return (
    <section className="space-y-3">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium">Revenue trend</h3>
      <RevenueChart />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Checklist

- [x] Consolidate navigation and IA
- [x] Introduce streaming KPI sections
- [x] Replace blocking charts with dynamic imports
- [x] Add skeletons and optimistic transitions
- [x] Tighten color, spacing, and type scales
- [ ] A/B test card density presets
- [ ] Expand keyboard shortcuts to filters

> Result: stakeholders report faster onboarding, fewer “where is X?” questions, and reduced dashboard abandonment during peak hours.

## What’s next

- Expand anomaly detection to Alerts with explainers.
- Ship saved views with shareable, signed URLs.
- Continue trimming JS with lighter chart primitives on mobile.
