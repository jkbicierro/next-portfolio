A comprehensive image optimization strategy for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. By switching to modern formats, responsive sizing, and lazy loading, we cut image payload by 85% without quality loss.

## Problem Statement

- Hero images: 4–8MB per page, blocking LCP.
- Product grids: unoptimized PNGs, redundant sizes.
- Mobile users: paying for desktop resolution on 375px screens.

## Solution

### Format Modernization

| Format | Size  | Browser Support | Best For |
| ------ | ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| WebP   | 1.2MB | 96% global      | Photo    |
| AVIF   | 980KB | 88% global      | Photo    |
| SVG    | 45KB  | 100%            | Icons    |

### Responsive Images with `next/image`

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <Image
      src={product.imageUrl}
      alt={product.name}
      width={400}
      height={300}
      sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL={product.blurUrl}
      quality={75}
    />
  );
}
```

### Lazy Loading Strategy

- Above fold: eager load, priority=true, no blur.
- Below fold: lazy load (default), blur placeholder, lower quality.
- Intersection Observer for intersection-based loading on custom images.

## Results

- LCP improved from 4.2s to 2.1s (50% faster).
- Total image payload: 8.2MB → 1.2MB (85% reduction).
- Mobile bounce rate down 12%.
- Server cost savings: ~$8K/month (CDN bandwidth).

## Takeaways

- Modern formats matter; WebP/AVIF are production-ready.
- Blur placeholders improve perceived performance.
- Responsive sizing saves bytes; unused pixels are wasted bytes.

## Future Work

- Implement HEIC support for iOS users.
- A/B test blur strength and color accuracy.
